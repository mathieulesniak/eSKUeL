eSKUeL
========

Your new database companion
----------------------------------------

**eSKUeL** is a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) databases administration interface written in [PHP](http://www.php.net). It allow user to manage simply and fully one or more database without any advanced knowledge in SQL language.

Like [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/), **eSKUeL** can backup a table property, export and import the structure and/or the content of a database. You'll be able to add, delete one or more records, **control and optimize** the size of one table or database, rename or copy datas, in fact you'll can do everything phpMyAdmin does but better and **efficiently**.

Better because we tried to create a more attractive interface (just take a look at the screenshots), more ergonomic (you can quickly do everything), more "cross-browser" (no more bugging frames or dhtml) and customizable (you read it right!).

More efficient because we wanted each request to be the fastest of the world, a maximum of actions available and we wish that every advanced SQL user could use eskuel easily. But you'd better have to try eskuel now ! You'll see exactly what we mean.

**Requirements**

* [PHP 5+](http://www.php.net/)
* [MySQL support](http://www.php.net/manual/book.mysql.html) or [mysqli support](http://www.php.net/manual/book.mysqli.html) or sqlite ? msql ?

**Getting started**

Download and install eSKUeL on your server

	$ curl http://eskuel.com/install.sh | sh

Throw you favorite browser to your eSKUeL install location, setup your database credentials and enjoy
